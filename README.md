# Angular_trial -> ListingsWithAngular

This project creates an Angular app that lists houses for rent and shows the details of individual houses. Using features and concepts that are common to many Angular apps, this project is a good starting tutorial to practice coding in Angular.

## Angular pre-checks

- Check node version using `node --version` or install it if node is not available on the device.
- Install latest version of Angular using the command: `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
- Install an integrated development environment (IDE) if one is not already available. Ideally [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and add the [Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) extension for enhanced developer experience.
